Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothing could take the pain away
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
The sticks and the stones that
You used to throw have
Built me an empire
So don't even try
To cry me a river
'Cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
The sticks and the stones that
You used to throw have
Built me an empire
So don't even try
To cry me a river
'Cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
I'll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken
And now you know
I'll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken
And now you know
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

/// SECOND SONG

Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no it's not a phase 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find
'Cause I'm going out, I'll fake what's real
Can anyone respond?
It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
